== Eclipse GEF Image Export Plugin ==
This Eclipse plugin adds a entry in the Export Wizard (File -> Export -> General) to export images from GEF based editor diagrams.

== Using the plugin ==

To export a GEF diagram:
* Make sure that a GEF based editor is active
* Open File -> Export -> General -> ImageExport
* Choose a filetype from the available image types (note: depending on the installed ImageExport plugins more type might be available)
* Choose a location to save the image
* Click Finish

The exported image will (exactly) fit the contents of the editor, scaled at 100%.
If larger images are required it is adviced to export as SVG (using the ImageExport.SVG plugin) and scale in another program to the desired scale. And eventually reexport to a bitmap if required.

== Developer information ==
To add new formats
* Create a new plugin
* In the plugin.xml editor add a nl.utwente.ce.imageexport.exportFormatProvider extension
* Add a new iamge_format and fill in the required fields
* The provided class should implement the [https://github.com/veger/eclipse-gef-exportimage/blob/master/nl.utwente.ce.imageexport/src/nl/utwente/ce/imageexport/IImageFormatProvider.java IImageFormatProvider] interface.

The ImageExport.SVG should be easy enough to understand how this is done.
To see how to reuse the exporting class for multiple formats, the: ImageExport plugin itself is a nice example as one class is used for both PNG and JPEG images.

== License ==
The ImageExport plugins are licensed under GPL v3. See LICENSE file for more information.
